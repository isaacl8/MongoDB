-Create a database called 'my_first_db'.
show dbs
use my_first_db

-Create students collection.
db.createCollection('students')

-Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})
-Create 5 students with the appropriate info.
db.students.insert({name: "Isaac", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 18, birthday:{month: 9, day: 3, year: 1995}})
db.students.insert({name: "Larry", home_state: "Maine", lucky_number: 28, birthday:{month: 8, day: 6, year: 1990}})
db.students.insert({name: "Clark", home_state: "Arizona", lucky_number: 3, birthday:{month: 12, day: 9, year: 1976}})
db.students.insert({name: "Sophia", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 2, birthday:{month: 8, day: 23, year: 2005}})
db.students.insert({name: "Monica", home_state: "Texas", lucky_number: 68, birthday:{month: 1, day: 30, year: 1985}})

-Get all students.
db.students.find({}).pretty()

-Retrieve all students who are from California.
db.students.find({home_state: "California"}).pretty()

-Get all students whose lucky number is:
-greater than 4

db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gt:4}}).pretty()
-less than or equal to 10
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte:10}}).pretty()

-between 1 and 9 (inclusive)
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte:9, $gte:1}}).pretty()

-Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY.  It should contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation.
db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {intrests: ['coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB']}})

-Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.
db.students.update({name:"Monica"}, {$push: {intrests: "taxes"}})

-Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.
db.students.update({name:"Monica"}, {$pull: {intrests: "taxes"}})

-Remove all students who are from California.
 db.students.remove({home_state: "California"})

-Remove a user by name(created a blank person so I can delete by id).
db.students.remove({_id: ObjectId("5961719398289bb11e86b649")})

-Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.
db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {number_of_belts: 0}})

-Increment this field by 1 for all students.
db.students.updateMany({number_of_belts: 0}, {$set: {number_of_belts: 1}})

-Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'
db.students.update({}, {$rename: {"number_of_belts":"belts_earned"}}, false,true)

-Remove the 'lucky_number' field.
db.students.update({}, {$unset: {lucky_number: ""}})

-Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date.
db.students.updateMany({},{$currentDate: {Updated_On:{$type: "date" }}})
